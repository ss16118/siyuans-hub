## Siyuan Shen's Website

Welcome to my website. I'm currently a third-year student at Imperial College London, I am what they call a seasoned (or veteran) otaku (and definitely a man of culture as well). The things that I enjoy are quite diverse, just to list a few: anime, manga, American TV series, Japanese TV series, Korean TV series, video games, movies, English literature, sci-fi novels, rock music, jazz, and blues. Although I'm pretty much familiar or let's say acquainted with each of those, there isn't one single subject that I've focused on, and I can't say I'm knowledgeable about any of them.

To be honest, I haven't really thought of what to do with this website yet. It all started when I found that a senior in my department has a personal website that he uses to share his course notes and CV. That's when I had the sudden urge to build my own platform to show the personal projects that I have done. Well, compared to other students in my year, the projects I have are not even worth mentioning. Recently, I started having this idea of writing my own blog posts and stuff, and I thought it's not such a bad idea to publish them on my website. I know there are other platforms that provide the same service, like Zhihu (Chinese version of Quora) and CSDN, but hey, I'm a programmer, and we programmers like to build things on our own if we can. Therefore, I decided in the end to host everything I want to share on this site. It only has two sections now, and I'll add more features in the future. There aren't any posts in my blog yet, and I just can't be bothered to add the "sort by category" feature. I'll probably have that functionality added once I have written a few articles. Like I mentioned at the start, the things I like are pretty varied, so be prepared to see a bunch of articles on completely unrelated subjects. Frankly speaking, the personal projects section is kind of unnecessary, since the projects worth showing are almost all from group projects at school.

I guess there won't be too many visitors (if there are any visitors at all), yet if you want to share your interests with me or if you have suggestions to make, feel free to contact me. My contact info is as follows:

> P.S. All contents on this site are in both English and Chinese, and since translation is not my forte, please excuse the mistakes that I've made. It's my first time using React, that's why the UI seems a bit crude, and there are probably bugs as well. Thanks for understanding.
