<h4 align="center"> A Brief Discussion on the Differences between the Movie Adaptation and Original Novel of "Ready Player One" </h4>

Cyberpunk has been one of my all-time favorite (if not my most favorite) sci-fi sub-genres, and I have always tried to get my hands on the related novels and movies. Last year, I was on Google searching for recommendations for novels that belong to the Cyberpunk genre, and I found "Ready Player One" as one of the [recommended books](https://www.cyberpunks.com/five-cyberpunk-books-youve-gotta-read/). To be honest, I felt that the Cyberpunk elements in the movie adaption of "Ready Player One" didn't really stand out. After finishing the original novel a few days ago, I realized that there is certainly a world of difference between the two. Now, I will list and briefly talk about the primary changes in setting, plot, and characters that the movie has made to the original novel.

### Setting

1. In the very first chapter, our protagonist Wade introduces the twenty-first century that he lives in with a pessimistically bleak and rather nihilistic tone. From the quotes below, it's not hard to see that in the book, the entire globe suffers from the energy crisis, climate change, and incessant wars. A huge chunk of the world's population is forced to live on the street and survive with rations and food vouchers the government provides, or cram in stacks built with shabby mobile trailers like the one Wade's aunt has. From what is later depicted in the novel, we can see that Wade's living conditions are far from well-off, as cold and hunger are always things that he needs to be concerned with. He even has to charge the battery in his secret hiding place by peddling a bike, for christ's sake. These are barely mentioned in the film, even though we can sort of tell from the background and the extras. In the end, however, the quick montage in the beginning of the movie only scratches the surface of the arduous struggles and toils of the plebeian life in the original novel. The book's detailed depiction of the general setting not only puts emphasis on the Cyberpunk element but also highlights the importance of OASIS as a way to escape the harsh reality to the populace.

   > For me, growing up as a human being on the planet Earth in the twenty-first century was a real kick in the teeth. Existentially speaking.

   > ...

   > We call this the Global Energy Crisis, and it's been going on for a while now.

   > ...

   > and the weather is all messed up. Plants and animals are dying off in record numbers, and lots of people are starving and homeless. And we're still fighting wars with each other, mostly over the few resources we have left.

   > ...

   > So now you have to live the rest of your life knowing you're going to die someday and disappear forever.
   > "Sorry."

2. After reading the novel, I realized that the movie made a **HUGE** change to Halliday's Easter egg hunt. In the book, to obtain the final Easter egg, not only do people need to retrieve the three hidden keys, but they also have to discover three Gates that correspond to each of the keys and pass the challenges behind each Gate. I will talk more about the Gates in the next section. I have no idea whether it's due to the time constraint of the movie or the changes in the general theme, they have decided not to include anything related to the Gates in the movie. Therefore, compared to the puzzles in the novel, the ones in the movie are basically child's play.

3. Since the movie changed the plot completely, it only makes sense for them to ignore everything related to the public school system on OASIS.

### Plot

1. Obviously, the most noticeable change the movie has made is the plot, especially the main story arc that provides most of the conflicts: Halliday's Easter egg hunt. First of all, in the original novel, there are no such things as the car race (even though it's kinda cool) and the museum that stores Halliday's memory. The first key is hidden in a replica of one of Dungeons and Dragons' modules called [Tomb of Horrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors) on planet Ludus, where Wade's school is located. To actually obtain the copper key, the characters have to beat the lich, who's the boss at the end of the level, in a best-of-3 match of [Joust](<(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joust_(video_game))>), an old arcade game.
   After acquiring the copper key, you then have to travel to a planet called Middletown, which contains a bunch of copies of Halliday's hometown, and pass a game called [Dungeons of Daggorath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_of_Daggorath) in Halliday's childhood room. The Gate appears after that. Now, you have to enter the Gate and act as the protagonist David of [WarGames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames), that is to say you have to repeat the lines and actions of the character in that movie. Only then does that count as completing the first Gate, and the clue to the next key is given.
   That is rough I know. Well, the puzzles to the second and third Gate are definitely similar to those of the first, if not more difficult to solve, and there are countless pop culture references involved as well. Please forgive me for skipping the rest of the puzzles. If you are really interested, I suggest that you go on the [wikipedia page](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joust_(video_game)>) of "Ready Player One" to find out more.

1. Our protagonist Wade is flat-ass broke in the beginning of the novel. His avatar has no items or levels, and he can't even afford the travel cost that gives him access to other planets. He is normally stranded at school, and only travels occasionally by hitchhiking with his friend Aech. The costumes and items of Parzival shown at the start of the movie are only obtained by Wade after beating the first Gate in the book.

2. The relationships between the members of The High Five in the movie are definitely much more "embellished" when compared to the original novel. Firstly, only Parzival and Aech are friends at the start of the book, the other members of The High Five, Art3mis, Daito and Shoto joined later. Parzival and Art3mis first met in the Tomb of Horrors, and the first meeting of The High Five is held after all of them have passed the first Gate. In the beginning, things are kinda tense between Aech and Daito, and the meeting does not really end on a good note for them. In addition, the novel spends a good deal of time depicting the overwhelmingly stressful tensions and competitions among Gunters, and there is definitely no intel sharing in The High Five (except between Daito and Shoto of course). In the movie, the vibe within our protagonists' little group can only be described as tacit and cheerful. On the contrary, the Easter egg hunt has always been a large relationship obstacle for Parzival and Art3mis in the book, even till the very end of the story. During the search for the second key, Art3mis decides to bring her relationship with Parzival to an end, although they are almost together as a couple. Her actions are basically driven by her fervor for the Easter egg, and from her perspective, her interactions with Parzival are seen as distractions. In the original novel, the actions of each member of The High Five are governed by the Law of the Jungle and Social Darwinism, which is nothing like the warm-and-fuzzy festive feeling shown in the movie.

3. It can be said that our protagonist Wade played a more important role in the novel, while actions of other members in The High Five are less crucial. For instance, in the movie, Samantha (Art3mis) chooses to sacrifice herself to allow Wade to escape, whereas in the book, it was Wade whom voluntarily infiltrates the IOI alone by pretending to be indentured, and steals the incriminating files from IOI's internal database. To be honest, I was quite impressed by Wade's overpowerful hacking skills as well as the plot armor the author decides to put on him when he is hacking the intranet.

4. Before the final battle in the novel, The High Five ("The High Four" to be exact) is being pursued by the agents of IOI, and it was Ogden Morrow, acting as the Deus Ex Machina character, who rescues them, or rather provides his luxurious mansion as the sanctuary for them. Hence, there was definitely no such scene even remotely close to the Hollywood-style car-chase in the novel.

5. The movie's depiction of the antagonist, IOI and Sorrento, was a lot like that of other Hollywood blockbusters: pompous and brain-dead. As it is portrayed in the film, IOI and Sorrento basically showed little to no threats to The High Five (except maybe sending drones to detonate the trailer of our protagonist's aunt and the car-chase) throughout the story. In comparison, the antagonist in the novel is much more menacing as IOI follows The High Five closely during the entire Easter egg hunt. They even find the second Gate and the crystal key before The High Five. The tone is quite bleak and sprinkled with a sense of despair in the second half of the book. At one point, Wade even considers that when the worst-case scenario happens, that is when IOI takes over the OASIS, he is going to commit suicide by jumping off the top of the building. In short, IOI in the original novel no doubt has much more of an evil villainous cyberpunk-style multinational corporation feel to it. Oh, one important thing that I forgot to mention, in the book, IOI **actually kills Daito**. You heard me right, IOI murders Daito by throwing him off the window of his apartment. Well, this is definitely left out for the PG 10+ movie.

6. The ending of the book does not mention how Wade and his friends run the OASIS, so there is no shutting-down-the-server-two-days-a-week decision.

### Characters

1. Only Wade and Aech live in the US in the original novel. Art3mis (Samantha) is Canadian, Daito and Shoto are Japanese.

2. Our protagonist Wade is an overweight ugly dude in the beginning of the novel. He only becomes kinda fit after he sets a lock to his account to force himself to exercise before logging into OASIS. I gotta say the actor they picked fits the character description somewhat since he's definitely not too attractive.

3. Aech is a large African American lesbian in the novel, and she got kicked out of home due to her mother's detest towards homosexuals. After she saved enough money, she bought an old RV and started wandering the country. She is Wade's best friend, or his only friend rather, at the start. They grow apart in the middle of the story and make peace before the final battle.

4. Art3mis is not a member of some secret rebellion group in the novel, judging by the description, she's just a Canadian hikikomori girl with an inferiority complex and a noticeable birthmark on her face. She's supposed to be one year or two older than Wade. I think that personality-wise Art3mis in the book is a lot different from her character in the movie. She seems to feel that finding the Easter egg is much more significant than her relationship with Wade in the novel, and that's why she stops contacting our protagonist and starts focusing on solving the puzzles in the middle of the story.

5. Daito and Shoto first show up in the book as brothers, although they have no real family connection. At the start, they don't really have a good relationship with other members of The High Five. They complete a quest with Parzival and that seems to be the only interaction they have before the discovery of the crystal key. Shoto vows to revenge his brother after Daito's death, and sacrifices his avatar to buy time for other members in the final battle.

6. The appearance of Og and Halliday is different in the novel as Halliday is described to be tall and thin while Og looks more like Steve Wozniak.

### Other Details

1. Wade and his aunt's relationship can only be described as dreadfully horrible in the original novel, and his aunt only adopted him for his food vouchers. That is why Wade doesn't rush home after receiving the death threat from Sorrento. When his aunt dies in the explosion, Wade actually feels more sorry for Mrs. Gilmore, the kind old lady whom a lot of people may not even remember.

2. Parzival transforms into Ultraman in the novel, it's a shame that they didn't show that scene in the movie.

3. The coin that gives Parzival a second life is obtained by Wade after beating Pac-Man with a perfect score while searching for the jade key.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, there is a significant difference in the overall atmosphere of the movie adaptation and the novel. Although the endings of both works are nearly the same, the way the plot is developed in the novel is much more pressing and downright somber. No matter from which perspective you look at the two works, whether it be the setting, plot, or characters, the original novel undoubtedly puts more emphasis on the cyberpunk elements as well as the "High Tech Low Life" aspect of the society. Unfortunately, the essence and highlights of the Cyberpunk sub-genre had to be left out in the film, which is a sad compromise that had to be made so as to make the movie as family-friendly as possible. There are a lot of differences in the book which I haven't covered, and if you are an avid fan of Cyberpunk like me, reading the novel is definitely not a bad choice.

P.S. There are references to Cowboy Bebop and the Firefly in the novel, as an otaku, I was seriously moved.
